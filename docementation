STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR

1. Introduction

The Student Grade Calculator is a Python-based console application developed to calculate student grades based on marks obtained. The program accepts student details, validates user input, determines grades using conditional logic, and displays encouraging feedback. This project is designed to strengthen understanding of core Python concepts such as functions, conditional statements, loops, and error handling.

2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To accept student name and marks as input

To validate marks entered by the user (0–100 only)

To calculate grades using if-elif-else conditions

To display motivating messages for each grade

To implement modular programming using functions

To follow professional coding and documentation standards



---

3. Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Platform: Console / Terminal

Development Environment: Any Python-supported IDE or command line

External Libraries: None



---

4. Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized directory structure:

grade_calculator.py – Main Python program file

README.md – Project overview and setup instructions

test_cases.txt – Contains test cases and expected outputs

screenshots/ – Stores screenshots of program execution


This structure ensures easy navigation and maintainability.


---

5. Grading Logic

The grading system is designed based on the following rules:

Marks Range	Grade

90 – 100	A
80 – 89	B
70 – 79	C
60 – 69	D
0 – 59	F


Each grade is associated with an encouraging message to motivate students.

6. Program Description

6.1 Input Module

The program first asks the user to enter the student name and marks. Marks input is validated using a while loop to ensure only values between 0 and 100 are accepted.

6.2 Validation Logic

Input validation is handled using:

while loop to repeat input until valid

try-except block to catch non-numeric values


This prevents the program from crashing due to invalid input.

6.3 Grade Calculation Module

The grade is calculated using if-elif-else statements based on the marks entered. Each condition returns a grade and a corresponding motivational message.

6.4 Output Module

The final output displays:

Student name

Marks obtained

Grade

Encouraging message



---

7. Functions Used

get_valid_marks()

Accepts marks input

Ensures marks are within 0–100

Repeats input for invalid values


calculate_grade(marks)

Determines grade based on marks

Returns grade and message


main()

Controls overall program execution

Calls validation and grading functions

Displays final output



---

8. Algorithms Used

Algorithm for Grade Calculation

1. Start program


2. Read student name


3. Read marks


4. If marks < 0 or > 100, ask again


5. If marks >= 90, assign grade A


6. Else if marks >= 80, assign grade B


7. Else if marks >= 70, assign grade C


8. Else if marks >= 60, assign grade D


9. Else assign grade F


10. Display result


11. End program

9. Testing and Validation

Testing was conducted using various inputs including:

Valid inputs

Boundary values (0 and 100)

Invalid inputs (negative, above 100, non-numeric)


All test cases and expected outputs are documented in the test_cases.txt file.


---

10. Screenshots

Screenshots are included in the screenshots folder demonstrating:

Program execution

Invalid input handling

Final output display


These screenshots serve as visual proof of functionality.


---

11. Limitations

Supports only one student at a time

Console-based interface only

No data storage or file handling



---

12. Future Enhancements

Support for multiple students

Store results in files or databases

Add graphical user interface (GUI)

Generate reports automatically



---

13. Conclusion

The Student Grade Calculator project successfully implements core Python programming concepts with proper validation, grading logic, and documentation. The project meets all academic requirements and demonstrates good coding practices suitable for beginner-level software development.
